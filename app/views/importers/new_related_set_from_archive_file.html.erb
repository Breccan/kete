<h3>Some things to keep in mind when uploading a batch of
  <%= @zoom_class_plural_humanized -%> in a .zip, .tar, .gz, or other
  archive file:</h3>

<ul>
  <li><p>The archive file should be of a folder containing the items to
  be added.  Please do not uses spaces in the folder name and name the
  archive file after the folder.  For example "the_images" folder
  would become the "the_images.zip" archive file.</p></li>
  <li><p>The largest archive file you may upload is
  <%= number_to_human_size(MAXIMUM_UPLOADED_FILE_SIZE) -%>.  You may want to scale down
  your <%= @zoom_class_plural_humanized -%> to be more reasonable
  sized to add to the site and recreate your archive file.</p></li>

  <li><p>The title for the uploaded <%= @zoom_class_plural_humanized
  -%> will be based on the file's name as it was before it was added
  to the compressed archive file.  If you want a different title for
  the <%= @zoom_class_humanized -%> you may to rename the file in
  question and recreate the archive file before you proceed.</p>
  <p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE: please do not use spaces in file names,
  use an underscore instead.  "_" will be replaced with a space in
  the final title for the item.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE: please do not use &amp; in file names,
  use an "and" instead.  Items with ampersands in filenames will not
  be added.</strong></p>
  <p>Alternatively, you may also edit any uploaded <%= @zoom_class_humanized -%>'s title or
  other details after it has been added to the site.</p></li>
