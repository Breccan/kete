= Incremental Upgrade Instructions

Originally contributed by James Stradling <james@katipo.co.nz> - 2008-05-16

The following steps are only necessary if you continuously upgrade your code base to the latest Kete trunk.
Occasionally there are additional minor steps needed to update your Kete installation between revisions.
You can find these by scrolling down to the time where you last updated Kete, and going up through the additional steps.

GENERAL NOTE: If you have a lot of things to do, you could alternatively follow the upgrade guide mentioned above, which is
essentially a collection of all the commands used below into one step by step guide.

GENERAL NOTE: It is assumed you are upgrading from an earlier functional and unmodified trunk version. If not, be sure to preserve
the customizations you want to keep when you upgrade the code base.

GENERAL NOTE: Quite often you'll only have to do steps once to get the changes from multiple revisions.  In other words,
if a step is listed from multiple revisions, you only have to do it once.

IMPORTANT NOTE: For any steps where you run, "rake db:migrate", it is a good idea to back up your database before you run that step.

GENERAL NOTE: if you are upgrading your production Kete instance rather than development, you'll add "RAILS_ENV=production" to all rake tasks.

GENERAL NOTE: if you are running in production mode, you may also want to do a "rake tmp:cache:clear" as your last step to any of these.
However, if you updated your code via a Capistrano deploy, this is probably not necessary.

== 2008/11/12 - Better handling of unicode characters in search records

1.      Update to the latest Kete version using Git (and Capistrano if you've chosen this deployment method)
2.      Restart your mongrels or mod_rails
3.      Restart your backgroundrb instance
4.      If you have existing records that have non-latin characters in them, rebuild your search records (see other tasks below for summary under "Use the web interface to repopulate your Zebra database...")

== 2008/10/16 - Location of uploaded files changed and corrected

Due to an error in recent Kete releases, uploaded audio recordings and videos were stored in an incorrect location. This version of Kete fixes this issue, and as a result you may need to move your uploaded files to the correct folder.

To upgrade, please follow these instructions:

1.      IMPORTANT: Back up your Kete instance, including MySQL and full application folder
2.      Update to the latest Kete version using Git (and Capistrano if you've chosen this deployment method)
3.      Run rake kete:repair:check_uploaded_files to see if any files need to be relocated in your Kete instance
4.      Run rake kete:repair:correct_upload_locations to move files ONLY if necessary

Note: If you're using Capistrano to manage your Kete instance deployments, you may also need to retrieve uploaded files from earlier releases as they may have been archived. See http://kete.net.nz/documentation/topics/show/207 for full details.

== 2008/10/01 - Private files need to be copied to system folder

Due to a missing configuration in the Capistrano deployment recipes, private files were archived every time the site was deploy.
A fix has been committed which resolves the problem for future deployments. But you need to manually copy the old private files
from the releases/[timestamp]/private directory to the new system folder at shared/system/private

== 2008/09/17 - CSS "tags" Identifier Changed

To fix an IE6 specific printing bug, the CSS identifier "tags" has been changed to "tags-box". If you are running Kete with a custom theme, be sure to update your theme templates and CSS files to refer to the new "tags-box" CSS identifier, and not the older "tags".

The default Kete template has already been updated.

Once this has been completed, you may need to update and restart your Kete based website to effect the changes.

Complete steps are:

1.      Update all references to the "tags" CSS identifier in custom template(s) as mentioned below:
        a)  id="tags" should be changed to id="tags-box" in HTML templates
        b)  #tags should be changed to #tags-box in CSS templates
        The default Kete templates have already been updated.
2.      Run tmp:cache:clear (not necessary for capistrano deployments)
3.      Restart your Kete server

== 2008/08/07 - Fixing Caching Issues

1.      Stop your Kete server (mongrels, backgroundrb).
2.      Upgrade your code base
3.      rake tmp:cache:clear (not necessary for capistrano deployments)
4.      Start your Kete server again (mongrels, backgroundrb)

== 2008/08/01 - Making search for contributions by a user be limited to login, rather than non-unique user name

3.      Start your Kete server again (mongrels)

== 2008/07/18 - Upgrading backgroundrb and packet gem

1.      Upgrade your code base

          $ gem uninstall packet --all
          $ gem install packet --version 0.1.7
3.      Edit config/backgroundrb.yml and update it to match the structure of config/backgroundrb.yml.example. Point the :memcached: section to the appropriate IP of the memcached server (default should usually suffice).
4.      Run the database migration 'rake db:migrate'
5.      Restart your Kete instance (mongrels)
6.      Restart your Backgroundrb instance:
          ./script/backgroundrb stop
